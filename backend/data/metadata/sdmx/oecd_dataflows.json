Regional values (labour force, employment and unemployment) in TL3 regions are used as data inputs and combined with gridded population data <a href=https://doi.org/10.2760/098587>(European Commission, GHSL Data Package 2023)</a>. FUA boundaries are intersected with TL3 borders to compute the share of the regional population that lives within FUAs in each region. This share is then applied to the variable of interest (e.g. employment) and allocated to the FUA. In case several regions intersect the FUA, the adjusted values of intersecting regions are summed. For countries where TL3-level data is not available, data for TL2 regions is used. This approach assumes that the variable of interest has the same spatial distribution as population. Therefore, the modelled indicators should be interpreted with caution.<br /><br />\nWhen a more granular level is available, data is aggregated for each FUA. For example in the United States, labour market data is available at the county-level (<a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/#cntyaa>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>), and then aggregated by FUA.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Defining FUAs and cities</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">The OECD, in cooperation with the EU, has developed a harmonised <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/oecd-definition-of-cities-and-functional-urban-areas.html\">definition of functional urban areas</a> (FUAs) to capture the economic and functional reach of cities based on daily commuting patterns <a href=https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264174108-en>(OECD, 2012)</a>.

The carbon price signal stems from the Effective Carbon Rate (ECR) - the sum of fuel excise taxes, carbon taxes and tradeable permits that effectively put a price on carbon emissions. Progress with carbon pricing is discussed against three benchmarks. The more progress a country has made towards the relevant benchmark value, the higher the CPS. For example, a CPS of 100% against a EUR 60 per tonne CO2 benchmark (CPS60) means that a country or the group of countries prices all carbon emissions from energy use at EUR 60 or more. A CPS of 0% means that the country prices no emissions at all. An intermediate CPS between 0% and 100% means that some emissions are priced, but that not all emissions are priced at a level that equals or exceeds the benchmark.<p>Companion dataset to Effective Carbon Rates (ECR). ECRs measure carbon pricing of CO2-emissions from energy use in more than 70 countries, including 45 OECD and G20 countries, covering over 80% of world emissions.

Comprehensive and effective CFC rules have the effect of reducing the incentive to shift profits from a market jurisdiction into a low-tax jurisdiction.</p><p>The OECD gathers information on progress related to the implementation of Action 3, namely:</p><ul><li>whether a jurisdiction has CFC rules in place;</li><li>the definition of CFC income,</li><li>whether CFC rules include a substantial economic activity test and, if so, the nature of the test, and, finally, whether any exceptions apply.</li></ul><p>In general, a CFC is defined as a foreign company that is either directly or indirectly controlled by a resident taxpayer. Jurisdictions apply a variety of criteria to determine control. Some approaches make reference to voting rights held by resident taxpayers or to shareholder value held by resident taxpayers, while others stipulate that a foreign company is a CFC if it carries out its operations in a low-tax jurisdiction and others base CFC designation on a taxation test (i.e., if the foreign company does not pay tax in its jurisdiction of residence). Jurisdictions also vary in their definitions of CFC income, with some applying CFC rules to any type of income while others apply them to only passive income (i.e., income from interest, rental property, dividends, royalties or capital gains). Finally, jurisdictions also vary in the presence of substantial activity tests.</p><p><b>Contact: </b><a href=\"mailto:CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org\">CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org</a></p></div><div class=\"col-sm-12\"><h3>Related Document</h3><a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/beps-actions/action3/\" target=\"_blank\">BEPS Action 3 Controlled Foreign Company</a></div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"col-sm-12\"><p>The OECD/G20 BEPS project identified the deductibility of interest as an important area of attention. In particular, profit shifting can arise from arrangements using third party debt (e.g., where one entity or jurisdiction bears an excessive proportion of the group’s total net third party interest expense) and intragroup debt (e.g., where a group uses intragroup interest expense to shift taxable income from high tax to low tax jurisdictions).</p><p>In response, the 2015 BEPS Action 4 report focused on the use of all types of debt giving rise to excessive interest expense or used to finance the production of exempt or deferred income. In particular, the Action 4 final report established rules that linked an entity’s net interest deductions to its level of economic activity within the jurisdiction, measured using taxable earnings before interest income, tax, depreciation and amortisation. This included three main elements:</p><ul><li>A fixed ratio rule based on a benchmark net interest/EBITDA ratio</li><li>A group ratio rule allowing an entity to deduct more interest expense based on the position of its worldwide group</li><li>Targeted rules to address specific risks not addressed by the general rule.</li></ul><p>Further work on two aspects of the approach outlined in the Action 4 report was completed in 2017. The first addressed key elements of the design and operation of the group ratio rule, focusing on the calculation of net third party interest expense, the calculation of group-EBITDA and approaches to address the impact of entities with negative EBITDA. The second identified features of the banking and insurance sectors which can constrain the ability of groups to engage in BEPS involving interest, together with limits on these constraints, and approaches to deal with risks posed by entities in these sectors.</p><p>The OECD gathers information on progress related to the implementation of Action 4, namely, whether a jurisdiction has an interest limitation rule in place and, if so, the main design features of the rule. Design features include:</p><ul><li>the type of rule (e.g., thin capitalisation, earnings stripping)</li><li>the financial ratio referenced</li><li>whether the rule is applicable to net or gross interest</li><li>whether the rule is applicable to related party debt and/or third party debt</li><li>whether a de minimus threshold is present</li><li>whether any exclusions apply</li><li>whether any loss carry-back or carry-forward provisions apply</li></ul><p><b>Contact: </b><a href=\"mailto:CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org\">CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org</a></p></div><div class=\"col-sm-12\"><h3>Related Document</h3><a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/beps-actions/action4/\" target=\"_blank\">BEPS Action 4 Interest Limitation Rules</a></div>",

These regimes also provide benefits to income from other geographically mobile activities or provide benefits to a wide range of activities and do not necessarily exclude income from IP. The table shows information both on regimes that narrowly target IP income and on regimes that offer reduced rates to IP income and other types of income.</p><p>As agreed as part of the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard, peer reviews are undertaken to identify features of IP regimes that can facilitate base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) and therefore have the potential to unfairly impact the tax base of other jurisdictions. The Action 5 Report placed a renewed focus on requiring substantial activity for any preferential regime, and the “nexus approach” is the substantial activity requirement developed for IP regimes. The nexus approach requires a link between the income benefiting from the IP regime and the extent to which the taxpayer has undertaken the underlying R&D that generated the IP asset. In addition to the nexus approach, features of regimes such as ring-fencing from the domestic economy and a lack of transparency are also considered in the peer reviews.</p><p><b>Contact: </b><a href=\"mailto:CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org\">CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org</a></p></div><div class=\"col-sm-12\"><h3>Related Document</h3><a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/inclusive-framework-on-beps-progress-report-july-2018-may-2019.htm\" target=\"_blank\">OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS: Progress Report July 2018-May 2019</a></div>",

    "description": "The OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index (FDIRRI) - Regulatory Database provides information on all regulatory measures underlying the FDIRRI, including extracts of key legislation, explanatory comments, sources, and links. The Regulatory Database also shows the scores associated with each individual regulatory measure. Please note, however, that these do not represent sector or economy-level scores. Note also that the horizontal (cross-sector) measures recorded in the database may not necessarily apply to all sectors or sub-sectors and may sometimes overlap with other sector-specific database entries. The overlap of horizontal and sector-specific entries does not affect FDIRRI scores, i.e., it does not result in double counting. For cross-country comparisons, users should refer to the <a href=\"http://data-explorer.oecd.org/s/uj\">OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index - Scores database</a>. <p>The OECD FDIRRI is a policy-based tool designed to measure statutory restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) across countries and over time. First established in 2003 and last revised in 2022, the FDIRRI serves as a benchmark for evaluating market access and other regulatory barriers to FDI, while also providing a means to monitor and promote FDI policy reforms. The FDIRRI assesses regulatory restrictions in 22 economic sectors, categorised into four policy areas: foreign equity limits, screening and approval, restrictions on key foreign personnel, and other restrictions. Only statutory measures that discriminate against foreign investors, or which are deemed particularly more burdensome to foreign investors, are accounted for as restrictions. Other important aspects of the investment climate (e.g., regulatory transparency, state monopolies, and any preferential treatment for selected investors, such as treaty-covered investors or those in special economic zones), as well as measures implemented for protecting the public order and essential security interests are not considered. Each policy measure is scored on a scale from 0 (fully open to FDI) to 1 (fully closed), with sectoral scores reflecting the sum across all policy categories, capped at 1. Standard sector weights are applied consistently across countries and over time to capture differences in the economic significance of sectors, ensuring that any variation in scores between countries is attributed to policy differences.

The OECD has published data on CPA at the aggregate level (provider-partner country) since 2007.</p><p>This data represents an update to the measurement of CPA. The main improvement is that this version is derived entirely from the OECD's aid activity database, the Creditor Reporting System (CRS). CPA is calculated by subtracting the following categories of aid from the total of gross bilateral ODA (category = 10):</p><ul><li>Debt relief (modality: F01 and sector: 600)</li><li>Humanitarian aid (sector codes: 720,730,740)</li><li>Administrative costs not included elsewhere (modality: G01 and sector: 910)</li><li>Scholarships/training in donor country (modality: E01)</li><li>Imputed student costs (modality: E02)</li><li>Promotion of development awareness (modality: H01)</li><li>Refugees in donor country (modality: H02-H06 and sector: 930)</li><li>Core support to NGOs (modality: B01)</li><li>Equity investments (measure: 5xx)</li><li>Other unallocated (sector code: 998 OR recipient: \"Developing countries unspecified\")</li><li>CPA = 1 (see \"Agency\" sheet in the 'DAC and CRS code lists', under <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/data/insights/data-explainers/2024/10/resources-for-reporting-development-finance-statistics.html\">Resources and guidance material for reporters</a>)</li></ul><p>This measurement is an improvement from the previous CPA measure, which was derived from a combination of the OECD's aggregate aid tables and the CRS, resulting in an aggregate (provider-partner country) perspective on CPA. The result of the new measure is an activity-level perspective on CPA that provides much greater transparency on its composition and thereby allows users to conduct more granular analysis (e.g., by sector, channel, modality, etc.) on who is giving CPA where, how, and for what purpose. The measure is also therefore more replicable to users.</p><p>The time series of the CPA measure starts with 2022 in the “Table” view to differentiate it from the previous CPA measure, which was calculated at an aggregate level up to 2021. These two measures should not be presented together in a time series. For users who are interested in the time series using the new CPA measure, a version of the dataset that applies the new CPA measure retroactively from 2010 onwards has been produced and can be found under, “Related files”.</p><p>For more information on this measure, please see: <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/data/insights/data-explainers/2025/02/country-programmable-aid-in-official-development-assistance.html\">Country programmable aid in official development assistance (ODA)</a>.</p>",

As demands for information increase and more countries implement and institutionalise health accounts according to the system, the data produced are expected to be more comparable, more detailed and more policy relevant. It builds on the original OECD Manual, published in 2000 to create a single global framework for producing health expenditure accounts that can help track resource flows from sources to uses. It is the result of a collaborative effort between the OECD, WHO and the European Commission, and sets out in more detail the boundaries, the definitions and the concepts – responding to healthcare systems around the globe – from the simplest to the more complicated. The accounting framework is organised around a tri-axial system for the recording of healthcare expenditure, namely classifications of the functions of healthcare (ICHA-HC), healthcare provision (ICHA-HP), and financing schemes (ICHA-HF).",

This dataset provides information about the contribution mechanisms the particular financing schemes use to raise their revenues. Understanding the nature of the flows is of importance from the perspective of both health and public finance policy. For example, the classification of revenues makes it possible to distinguish between public and private funding of healthcare finance. Understanding how resources are raised by financing schemes is important for many countries, as many health systems are struggling with the issue of funding. The classification of revenues of financing schemes is suitable for tracking the collection mechanisms of a financing framework. Furthermore, the new classification makes it possible to analyse the contribution of the institutional units to health financing.",

While human resources are essential to the health and long-term care sector, physical resources are also a key factor in the production of health services. How much a country invests in new health facilities, diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, and information and communications technology (ICT) can have an important impact on the capacity of a health system to meet the healthcare needs of the population. Having sufficient equipment in intensive care units and other health settings helps to avoid potentially catastrophic delays in diagnosing and treating patients. Non-medical equipment is also important, notably the IT infrastructure needed to better monitor population health, both in acute situations and in the long term. Investing in capital equipment is therefore a prerequisite to strengthening overall health system resilience.",

Data are broken down by professional status - employees, total employment - sex and standardised age groups (15-24, 25-54, 55+, total).\n<p />\nNational definitions of part-time work vary considerably across OECD countries. Essentially three main approaches can be distinguished: i) a classification based on the worker’s perception of his/her employment situation; ii) a cut-off (generally 30 or 35 hours per week) based on usual working hours, with persons usually working fewer hours being considered part-timers; iii) a comparable cut-off based on actual hours worked during the reference week. A criterion based on actual hours will generally yield a part-time rate higher than one based on usual hours, particularly if there are temporary reductions in working time as a result of holidays, illness, short-timing, etc. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether a classification based on the worker’s perception will necessarily yield estimates of part-time work that are higher or lower than one based on a fixed cut-off. In one country (France) which changed from 1981 to 1982 from a definition based on an actual hours cut-off (30 hours) to one based on the respondent’s perception, the latter criterion appeared to produce slightly higher estimates.\n<p />\nOther factors as well affect the international comparability of the estimates. In some countries, the hours’ cut-off is based on hours for the main job, in others on total hours for all jobs. Certain countries do not consider unpaid family workers to be employed unless they work more than a minimum number of hours, so that such workers do not enter into counts for part-time workers. \n<p />\nIn order to facilitate analysis and comparisons over time, historical data for OECD members have been provided over as long a period as possible, often even before a country became a member of the Organisation.

The SPEI over a 12 month period enables identifying long-term drought, where values between -1 and 1 are typically considered as normal conditions.

The dataset also provides a global assessment of projected changes to extreme temperature using a variety of climate indices such as hot days, tropical nights, icing days, heating degree days and cooling degree days. For indicators on hot days and tropical nights, the dataset provides the option to select between three different temperature thresholds (i.e. for hot days Tmax > 30°C, Tmax > 35°C and Tmax > 40°C, while for tropical nights Tmin > 20°C, Tmin > 26°C and Tmin > 32°C). Furthermore, a variety of population and livestock exposure indicators are available for a subset of hazards.

Adjusted disposable income is derived from disposable income, but also includes the value of social transfers in kind received by households. Saving represents that part of disposable income (adjusted for the change in pension entitlements) that is not spent on final consumption goods and services.<br><br>\n\nIn this table, households are grouped on the basis of their main source of income, which is the income item that makes the largest contribution to the income of the household. Four categories are shown: wages and salaries, income from self-employment, net property income (mainly interest, dividends and rent), and current transfers received such as social benefits including social transfers in kind.<br><br>\n\nResults are presented in national currency and as averages per household and per consumption unit (you can choose these from the ‘Unit of measure’ filter). Results per consumption unit (equivalised income and saving) are obtained by dividing each household’s result by the number of consumption units, reflecting its consumption needs, for example by applying the standard OECD-modified equivalence scale, counting the first adult as 1, any additional people aged 14 and over as 0.5 and all children under 14 as 0.3.<br><br>\n\nThe default view of this table is for a single country (‘Reference area’ filter) and single year (‘Time period’ filter). In cases where countries appear to be greyed-out, data may be available for earlier years, and these can be selected by selecting a different start and end year in the ‘Time period’ filter. Users are recommended to select one country at a time to obtain a comprehensive overview of the distributional results for that country for a given period of time. Alternatively, you may select a specific item from the ‘Transaction’ filter to make cross-country comparisons. <br><br>\n\nFor more information on the (compilation of) these results, please see the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sdd/na/household-distributional-results-in-line-with-national-accounts-experimental-statistics.htm\"> webpage on household distributional results </a>.",

    "description": "The financial indicators are based on data compiled according to the 2008 SNA \"System of National Accounts, 2008\". Many indicators are expressed as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or as a percentage of Gross Disposable Income (GDI) when referring to the Households and NPISHs sector. The definition of GDP and GDI are the following:\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Gross Domestic Product:</u><br>\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is derived from the concept of value added. Gross value added is the difference of output and intermediate consumption. GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.138].\nGDP is also equal to the sum of final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers’ prices, less the value of imports of goods and services [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.139].\nGDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by producer units [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.140].\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Gross Disposable Income:</u><br>\nGross Disposable Income (GDI) is equal to net disposable income which is the balancing item of the secondary distribution income account plus the consumption of fixed capital. The use of the Gross Disposable Income (GDI), rather than net disposable income, is preferable for analytical purposes because there are uncertainty and comparability problems with the calculation of consumption of fixed capital.\nGDI measures the income available to the total economy for final consumption and gross saving [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.145].\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Definition of Debt:</u><br>\nDebt is a commonly used concept, defined as a specific subset of liabilities identified according to the types of financial instruments included or excluded. Generally, debt is defined as all liabilities that require payment or payments of interest or principal by the debtor to the creditor at a date or dates in the future.\nConsequently, all debt instruments are liabilities, but some liabilities such as shares, equity and financial derivatives are not debt [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 22.104].\nAccording to the SNA, most debt instruments are valued at market prices. However, some countries do not apply this valuation, in particular for securities other than shares, except financial derivatives (AF33).\nIn this dataset, for financial indicators referring to debt, the concept of debt is the one adopted by the SNA 2008 as well as by the International Monetary Fund in “Public Sector Debt Statistics – Guide for compilers and users” (Pre-publication draft, May 2011).\nDebt is thus obtained as the sum of the following liability categories, whenever available / applicable in the financial balance sheet of the institutional sector:special drawing rights (AF12), currency and deposits (AF2), debt securities (AF3), loans (AF4), insurance, pension, and standardised guarantees (AF6), and other accounts payable (AF8).\nThis definition differs from the definition of debt applied under the Maastricht Treaty for European countries. First, gross debt according to the Maastricht definition excludes not only financial derivatives and employee stock options (AF7) and equity and investment fund shares (AF5) but also insurance pensions and standardised guarantees (AF6) and other accounts payable (AF8). Second, debt according to Maastricht definition is valued at nominal prices and not at market prices.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo view other related indicator datasets, please refer to:\n<br>\nInstitutional Investors Indicators [add link]<br>\nHousehold Dashboard [add link]",

Government gross debt is shown in four categories: D1 to D4. D1 is the narrowest measure, comprising only two financial instruments: debt securities and loans. D4 (‘total gross debt’) is the broadest measure and includes debt securities, loans, Special Drawing Rights, currency and deposits, other accounts payable and insurance, pensions and standardised guarantees. \n<br>\n<br>\nThe D1 to D3 measures are comparable between OECD countries.

Two main features enable BaTIS to stand out as the international benchmark for any analysis on international trade in services:<br />I. BaTIS is complete and consistent. At present, only about 63% of world trade in services is bilaterally specified, and the percentage is even lower for the individual service categories. The OECD-WTO methodology leverages all available official statistics and combines them with estimations and adjustments to provide users with a complete matrix covering virtually all economies in the world.<br />II.

They are well known for providing advance warning of turning points in aggregate economic activity as measured by GDP or industrial production. As respondents provide answers on a 3 scale options (up, same, down, or above normal, normal, below normal), data are summarised in net balances corresponsing to the difference in % of positive over negative replies. Because of their collection mode, timeliness and immediate availability, they have proved to be a cost‑effective mean of generating timely information especially during crises. \nIn the late '90, in collaboration with the European Commission, the OECD has developed a system of harmonised business tendency surveys in order to collect and compare data across countries.\nThe EC Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs is since then in charge of running the program and collecting data across EU members, while the OECD helped the adoption and implementation \nof the same harmonised framework in non-EU OECD countries and BRIICS. By construction, BTS questions are formulated in order to exclude seasonal factors. Nevertheless all series are tested for seasonality by both the OECD (using x12) and by the EC for the EU member data (using DAINTIES).

Therefore, the main message of CLI movements over time is the increase or decrease, rather than the amplitude of the changes.  The OECD’s headline indicator is the amplitude adjusted CLI. In practice, turning points in the de-trended reference series have been found about 4 to 8 months (on average) after the signals of turning points had been detected in the headline CLI.

Typically they are based on a sample of households and respondents are asked about their assessments of the current situation and expectations for the immediate future.  In the case of consumer surveys their intentions concerning major purposes, economic situation now compared with the recent past and expectations for the immediate future.  Many survey series provide advance warning of turning points in aggregate economic activity as measured by GDP or industrial production. Such series are known as leading indicators in cyclical analysis. These types of survey series are widely used as component series in composite leading indicators. The main characteristic of these types of surveys is that instead of asking for exact figures, they usually ask for the direction of change e.g. a question on tendency by reference to a “normal” state, e.g. of production level.  Possible answers are generally of the five point scale type e.g. increase sharply/increase slightly/remain the same/fall slightly/fall sharply for consumer surveys.  In presenting the results as a time series, only the balance is shown. That is “same” or “normal” answers are ignored and the balance is obtained by taking the difference between percentages of respondents giving favourable and unfavourable answers.Virtually all consumer opinion survey data are presented as time series of balances in this dataset, either in raw or seasonally adjusted form.  Very few series are presented as indices, and where these exist they have generally been converted from underlying balances by countries before submitting the data to the OECD.<p /><a href=mailto:stat.contact@oecd.org>OECD statistics contact</a><p /><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/sdd\">Statistics and Data Directorate</a>",

Normalisation is achieved by subtracting from the CCI its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. A value of 100 is added for rescaling purposes. In this form, an OECD Consumer Barometer reading greater than 100 signals a boost in consumer confidence towards the future, indicating an attitude to spend more on major purchases in the coming year, complemented by a modest propensity to save. Conversely, values below 100 indicate a pessimistic approach towards future developments in the economy, valuing saving over consumption. <p /><a href=mailto:stat.contact@oecd.org>OECD statistics contact</a><p /><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/sdd\">Statistics and Data Directorate</a>",

    "description": "Financial Indicators aim to capture in quantitative terms an important but heterogeneous and fast evolving area. Key factors driving this change are:  globalisation of the financial markets;  maturing of national financial markets and therefore the structure of these markets required to service their needs;  increased sophistication of the actors in these markets;  rapid technological change; and evolving regulatory frameworks. Financial institutions react and adapt to these conditions by changing their strategies; by specialising, by diversifying or concentrating their activities, and by extending through mergers and acquisitions. As a consequence, there is almost constant evolution in the institutional structures in which financial markets operate.<p /><a href=mailto:stat.contact@oecd.org>OECD statistics contact</a><p /><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/sdd\">Statistics and Data Directorate</a>",

For others, they comprise retail trade and registration of passenger cars; and permits issued and work started for dwellings. Considerable effort has been made to ensure that the data are internationally comparable across all countries presented, coverage for as many countries as possible, and that all the subjects have reasonable length of time-series to assist analysis. Most data are available monthly and are presented as an index (where the year 2010 is the base year) or as a level depending on which measure is seen as the most appropriate and/or useful in the economic analysis context.

    "name": "Monetary aggregates",
    "description": "Monetary aggregates measure the amount of money circulating in an economy. National series are loaded as national currency stock series. Mostly, these are end-of-month. A few countries compile data more frequently e.g. weekly which enables them to calculate “average for the month” data. Series are also presented in index form, calculated by OECD. Monetary aggregates are always expressed in current price (“nominal” terms) because the amount of money required by an economy reflects current levels of economic activity and price. Here they are presented both as stock series in national currency and as indices in the OECD standard base year. There are many monetary aggregates. Statistically, they are items in the balance sheet of the banking system. They may be taken from either side (since credit series, which are banking assets, are sometimes labeled monetary aggregates) but are normally taken from the liabilities side. In the balance sheet the liabilities items are ordered, starting with very narrow definitions of money (such as notes and coin) and gradually widening through various types of bank accounts (e.g. sight deposits, term deposits) to very board items which include sophisticated products like financial derivatives. In other words, narrow money measures cover highly liquid forms of money (money as a means of exchange) while broad money includes the less liquid forms (money as a store of value). There were no internationally recognised standards for compiling monetary aggregates until the IMF published its Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual in 2000 (<a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/mfs/manual/index.htm\">Monetary and Financial Statistics Manua</a>). Cross-country comparability suffered as a result. Now, notably, the European Central Bank’s framework for constructing Euro area monetary aggregates is consistent with IMF principles and non-euro EU countries are also required to report data to ECB according to the framework as are EU candidate countries as part of their application process. A useful IMF link for national methodologies is <a href=\"http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrylist/\">IMF methodologies</a>.  Here is used a general definition of narrow money – M1 is: currency i.e. banknotes and coins, plus overnight deposits. M2 is: the sum of M1, deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years and deposits redeemable at notice of up to three months. And broad money – M3 is: the sum of M2, repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units and debt securities up to two years.<p />The narrow and broad money indices are calculated by OECD from the national stock series. Country indices are calculated by first estimating period averages where the country only supplies end-of-period stock data. The figure for the end of the previous period is taken as the opening stock for the current period. The arithmetic average of the two is the estimate for the period average. These, or true monthly averages where available, are divided by the annual average of the monthly data in the base period to obtain the index.<p /><a href=mailto:stat.contact@oecd.org>OECD statistics contact</a><p /><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/sdd\">Statistics and Data Directorate</a>",

The OECD ITIC dataset combines the largest and most detailed cross-country sample of official national statistics on observed CIF-FOB margins with model estimates, providing information on CIF/FOB margins for more than 200 reporters and 240 partners and over 1200 products (HS 2017 at 4 digits), covering the period 1995 to 2022.</p>\n<p>The OECD ITIC dataset is built in four steps. First, a gravity model is estimated based on the reported CIF/FOB margins at HS 6-digit product level (available for 34 countries). Second, the gravity-model coefficients are used to derive estimates for countries which do not explicitly report CIF/FOB margins. Third, the observations that could not be estimated by the model are derived from the estimated margins using standard statistical techniques. Finally, estimates are calibrated to explicitly reported data for countries that provide incomplete time series of observed margins. The final ITIC dataset consists of a combination of reported data and different types of estimates and includes specific codes which identify the methodology behind each observation.</p>\n<p>ITIC constitutes an important tool to further the understanding of global value chains and forms a crucial input to the development of coherent and balanced bilateral trade statistics.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<li>In ITIC, the reference area corresponds to the importer, while the counterpart area is the exporter.</li>\n<li> The margin is calculated as (CIF-FOB)/CIF and is the percentage of the CIF value of imports that correspond to the international transport and insurance costs.</li>\n<li>CIF = Cost, Insurance and Freight</li>\n<li>FOB = Free on Board</li>\n</ul>\n<p> For more information on the methodology, please refer to the working paper accompanying this dataset <a href=\" https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/recent-trends-in-transport-and-insurance-costs-and-estimates-at-disaggregated-product-level_b5dbab02-en?crawler=true\" >Recent trends in transport and insurance costs and estimates at disaggregated product level</a></p>\n<p>Users are encouraged to send their questions, or to signal any apparent errors, regarding this database to <a href=\"mailto:STAT.Contact@oecd.org\">STAT.Contact@oecd.org</a></p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/sdd\">http://www.oecd.org/sdd</a></div>",

    "description": "<p>This dataset contains monthly Comparative Price Levels (CPL) for OECD countries. CPLs are defined as the ratios of PPPs for private final consumption expenditure to exchange rates. They provide measures of differences in price levels between countries. The monthly PPPs used to derive the table are OECD estimates. The table is to be read vertically. Each column shows the number of specified monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy the same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case the representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is specified. Let’s take an example. If you are a Canadian citizen and you want to know the price level in Canada when compared to other countries, you have to look at the column Canada, where the price level is set at 100 for the whole column. If you have 120 for Finland, it means that the price level in Finland is 20% higher than in Canada. It means that you would spend 120 dollars in Finland to buy the same basket of goods and services when you spend 100 in Canada. </p> <p> The monthly PPPs used to derive the table are obtained by extrapolating 2022 PPPs for household final consumption expenditure using the relative rates of inflation between the countries as measured by their consumer price indices. Unless a country is a high inflation country, its PPP will tend to change slowly over time. Month-to-month changes in comparative price levels are more likely to be the result of exchange rate fluctuations. </p> <p> Updated data are available at the beginning of each month. <br> <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/purchasing-power-parities.html#CPLreleasedates\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for release dates</a></p> <p> OECD statistics contact: stat.contact@oecd.org",

    "description": "In the OECD Entrepreneurship Financing Database, venture capital is made up of the sum of early stage (including pre-seed, seed, start-up and other early stage) and later stage venture capital. As there are no harmonised definitions of venture capital stages across venture capital associations and other data providers, original data have been re-aggregated to fit the OECD classification of venture capital by stages. Korea, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and South Africa do not provide breakdowns of venture capital by stage that would allow meaningful international comparisons.</p><p>The attached table shows the correspondences between original data and OECD harmonised data for venture capital investments by stage.</p><p><a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/wbos/fileview2.aspx?IDFile=2aa27890-769e-4f10-843a-a654c5e7b24e\">https://stats.oecd.org/wbos/fileview2.aspx?IDFile=2aa27890-769e-4f10-843a-a654c5e7b24e</a></p><p>Venture capital is a form of equity financing particularly relevant for young companies with innovation and growth potential but untested business models and no track record; it replaces or complements traditional bank finance. The development of the venture capital industry is considered an important framework condition to stimulate innovative entrepreneurship. Aggregate data on venture capital provide useful information on trends in the venture capital industry.</p><p>These data are typically compiled by national or regional Private Equity and Venture Capital Associations, often with the support of commercial data providers. The quality and availability of aggregate data on venture capital have improved considerably in recent years; international comparisons, however, remain complicated because of two main problems.</p><p>The first difficulty comes from the lack of a standard international definition of venture capital. While there is a general understanding, the definition of the types of investments included in venture capital varies across countries and regions. In some cases, differences are purely linguistic; in others, they are more substantive. The second problem relates to the diverse methodologies employed by data compilers. The completeness and representativeness of venture capital statistics with respect to the venture capital industry of a country will differ depending on how data were collected.</p><p>The units used are : Millions of US Dollars and share of GDP.</p><p>OECD statistics contact: <a href=\"mailto:stat.contact@oecd.org\">stat.contact@oecd.org</a>",

The approach builds on insights from the OECD International Survey of Science (ISSA2021), in which researchers reported which SDG their research contributed to. Using these responses, a labelled dataset was created to fine-tune SciBERT, a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on scientific literature, enabling it to predict the probability of relevance of a given text to each of the 17 SDGs, or to none. The trained classifier is then applied to publication titles and abstracts from the Scopus Custom Data.

Income-based tax incentives provide relief in form of a reduced tax rate or tax exemption on revenues connected with outputs of the innovation activity of the firm. They comprise two broad categories of incentives: (i) intellectual property (IP) regimes that provide relief to the income derived from certain eligible IP assets (e.g. patent boxes), which can be related to the innovation activity of the firm, and (ii) dual category&rsquo; regimes which provide relief to the entirety of business income (i.e. not necessarily IP-based) but restricted to eligible businesses deemed to be engaged in R&amp;D or other innovation-related activities. The new indicator included in the OECD R&amp;D Tax Incentives database specifies the cost of income-based tax support for R&amp;D and innovation to governments in 2021 (or latest year), measured in terms of foregone tax revenue. It complements existing indicators in the OECD R&amp;D Tax Incentives database that reflect the level and structure of central government support for business R&amp;D in form of tax and direct support for business R&amp;D expenditures.</p>",

Implied R&amp;D tax subsidy rates are defined as 1 minus the B-Index, a measure of the before-tax income needed by a “representative” firm to break even on one additional monetary unit of R&amp;D outlay (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacek-Warda-2/publication/292239687_Measuring_the_value_of_RD_tax_treatment_in_OECD_countries/links/5e4abf18a6fdccd965aed319/Measuring-the-value-of-R-D-tax-treatment-in-OECD-countries.pdf\">Warda, 2001</a>; <a href=\"https://one.oecd.org/document/DSTI/STP/NESTI(2023)2/FINAL/en/pdf\">OECD, 2023</a>). The more generous the tax provisions for R&amp;D, the lower the before-tax breakeven economic return required by firms and the higher the implied marginal R&amp;D tax subsidy. The OECD time-series estimates of implied R&amp;D tax subsidy rates is based on headline tax credit and allowance rates. Due to limited historical data availability, the estimates are not adjusted for provisions that bound the tax benefits received by firms (e.g. ceilings, thresholds). They therefore provide an upper bound for the marginal tax subsidy implied by R&amp;D tax relief measures at central government level across countries over time. <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d16e6072-en\">OECD (2019)</a> provides a practical guide to using the OECD R&amp;D Tax Incentives database, describing the R&amp;D tax incentive time series data and highlighting their potential for internationally comparative work through descriptive indicators and econometric analysis.</p>",

Estimates of the cost of R&amp;D tax support at subnational government level are reported whenever such provisions are applicable and relevant data are available. These estimates of the cost of central and subnational R&amp;D tax relief have been combined with data on direct government funding of business expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD), as compiled by National Statistical Offices based on reports from firms, in order to provide a more complete picture of government efforts to promote business R&amp;D. Furthermore, these estimates are combined with data on Government budget allocations for R&amp;D (GBARD) in the broader context of overall budgetary support for R&amp;D activities undertaken by governments. Government budget allocations for R&amp;D include direct funding provided to all sectors, including contributions to R&amp;D programmes abroad. <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/d16e6072-en\">OECD (2019)</a> provides a practical guide to using the OECD R&amp;D Tax Incentives database, describing the R&amp;D tax incentive time series data and highlighting their potential for internationally comparative work through descriptive indicators and econometric analysis.</p>",

The database is compiled based on annual data collection by the OECD Secretariat for some countries and via collaboration with Eurostat, which collects statistics for all EU member states plus Norway and Switzerland. <p><p>The gross nutrient balances for nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P), expressed in tonnes, are calculated as the difference between the total quantity of nutrients entering an agricultural system (mainly as fertilisers and livestock manure) and the quantity of nutrients leaving the system (mainly via uptake by crops and grassland). The nutrient balance indicator can be used as a proxy to reveal the status of environmental pressures. A positive nutrient balance represents a nutrient surplus (inputs exceed outputs), which can lead to nutrient pollution of air and water resources. A negative nutrient balance represents a deficit (outputs exceed inputs), which can lead to degradation in soil fertility. The nutrient balance indicator is also reported on a per unit land area basis, in kilogrammes of nutrients per hectare of agricultural land. <p><p>For more information click on <a href= http://stats.oecd.org/wbos/fileview2.aspx?IDFile=fc286b6c-c339-C:\\Users\\takrouri-jolly_N\\OneDrive - OECD\\@statV8\\working file\\NutrientsBalances\\link48e6-8620-a4c28f3a1c25> Gross nitrogen Balances.pdf </a><p><p>For more information click on this link <a href= http://stats.oecd.org/wbos/fileview2.aspx?IDFile=fc286b6c-c339-C:\\Users\\takrouri-jolly_N\\OneDrive - OECD\\@statV8\\working file\\NutrientsBalances\\link48e6-8620-a4c28f3a1c25> Gross phosphorus Balances.pdf </a><p>",

    "description": "This dataset contains key internationally comparable indicators on children’s well being outcomes, a range of additional context indicators on important drivers of child well being, and child relevant public policies. The dataset is built using the latest available data from OECD databases and a range of leading international child surveys and data collection programmes. Indicators are selected based on a multi-dimensional and forward looking approach to child well-being, centred on the idea that children should be able to both enjoy a “good” positive childhood in the here and now, and have the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that set them up well for the future. While the data look to cover the well-being of children of all ages, limitations in data availability mean that most indicators focus on those in middle childhood and adolescence. This dataset represents a selection of headline indicators from the OECD Child Well-being Data Portal, a tool for policy makers and the public to monitor countries’ efforts to promote child well being. It is built on the OECD's Child Well-being Measurement Framework as set out in the OECD's 2021 report Measuring What Matters for Child Well-being and Policies.",

Typically, a large number of people keep a diary of activities over one or several representative days for a given period. Respondents describe their activities in their own words in a time diary and these are then re-coded by national statistical agencies into a set of descriptive categories. A well-designed survey classifies activities across a total duration of 24 hours (or 1 440 minutes) per day. Interest in time-use studies has grown considerably over the last 30 years and an increasing number of national statistical agencies have been conducting large-scale time-use surveys",
